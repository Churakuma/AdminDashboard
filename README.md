## About this Project
This project was meant as an introduction to utilising CSS Grid and was my first time attempting to build a webpage utilising it. It is currently remaining incomplete and requires some changes to make it responsive. It was done to further my understanding of what can be achieved using CSS and HTML by themselves. 

## Contribution
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request. This was a simple project I started to experiment further and develop my understanding of Web Development.

Thank you for using my web application! If you have any questions or require further clarification, please reach out!
